    ## why do we need to include the following routes?
    # Include the JWT Token Authentication routes to get and refresh tokens
    # If this is not included, the JWT Token Authentication will not work
    # it is good to include these routes in the main urls.py file

    # JWT Token Authentication routes
    path("api/token/", TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name="get_token"),  # Obtain JWT Token
    path("api/token/refresh/", TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name="refresh"),  # Refresh JWT Token

    # Custom API routes for creating Lecturer and Student
    path("api/lecturer/register/", CreateLecturerView.as_view(), name="create-lecturer"),  # Create Lecturer
    path("api/student/register/", CreateStudentView.as_view(), name="create-student"),  # Create Student

    # API Auth routes
    path("api-auth/", include("rest_framework.urls")),

    # Include app-specific URLs , these are used to create delete, update and retrieve modules assignments, submissions
    path("api/", include("api.urls")),
